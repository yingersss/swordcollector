Hexany's Monster Menagerie is a pack of 32x32 monochrome "1-bit" static creatures.
Intended as a multitile creature expansion to the "Hexany's Roguelike Tiles", but the creatures can also be used as JRPG/First Person Dungeon Crawl battlers (or whatever else you can come up with).

"Roguelike_Example.png" is using tiles from "Hexany's Roguelike Tiles" - https://hexany-ives.itch.io/hexanys-roguelike-tiles
